	<p> 
		There are many ways to build good credit. A few examples of how to do so are to borrow only what you can afford to pay back, use a small amount of your credit available, start with only one credit card and pay it back as soon as possible, and be on time with your payments. When starting to build credit, it is important to have only one card and to be mindful of what you are buying with it. One of the best ways one can build good credit is to only charge to your card what you can afford, that way you can pay it back quickly and on time. Also, maxing out your credit card is a bad sign to lenders, showing you are irresposible with your money and you cannot pay it back. There are many ways one can start to build credit, show in the list below.
